# chat-bot
Project Overview
What it does: Describe that the project is a Flask-based chatbot that uses a pre-built vector store to answer questions related to software engineering and coding interviews.
Key Features: Mention that it retrieves data from several knowledge-base URLs, preprocesses text, builds embeddings with a HuggingFace model, and then uses the OpenAI API to generate responses.
Installation & Requirements
System Requirements: List Python version (e.g., Python 3.8+).
Dependencies: Provide a list of required Python packages. For example:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install flask nltk langchain langchain_community langchain_huggingface certifi
Configuration: Explain that the API key should be stored in a separate config.py file. For example:
python
Copy
Edit
# config.py
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here'
Running the Application
Startup Instructions:
bash
Copy
Edit
python chat-bot.py
Endpoint Usage:
Provide an example of how to make a POST request to the /chat endpoint using cURL or Postman:
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST http://localhost:5012/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "How do I prepare for a coding interview?"}'
Code Explanation & Architecture
Global Initialization: Explain that the vector store (which is resource intensive) is built once at startup and reused for every incoming request. This optimization is implemented by initializing the vector store in the main block before starting the Flask server.
Request Flow:
Step 1: Receive and parse JSON input.
Step 2: Validate and grade the question for relevance.
Step 3: Use the pre-built vector store to perform a similarity search.
Step 4: Filter retrieved documents by grading their relevance.
Step 5: Generate the final answer using the OpenAI model.
Logging: Describe that detailed logging is in place to trace the flow of execution and assist with debugging.
